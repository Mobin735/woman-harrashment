                Unwelcome touching or other physical contact
                Asking or demanding sex or any other sexual activity
                Making remarks which are of a sexual nature
                Showing pornographic material which may include videos, magazines, books etc.
                There is a separate law on sexual harassment at workplaces - The Sexual Harassment of women at workplace
                (prevention, prohibition and redressal) Act and Rules 2013 . There are provisions in the main criminal
                law (the Indian Penal Code or IPC) which are different from the special law on sexual harassment:

                The IPC is not limited to sexual harassment at the workplace, but punishes such harassment done
                anywhere.
                The IPC makes it possible to file a criminal complaint if you have been sexually harassed, while the
                special law gives you the option of seeking civil remedies and damages, involving your office
                administration.
                The punishment for the first three kinds of sexual harassment is three years as compared to the fourth
                type (making sexually coloured remarks) which is one year.
